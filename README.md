# Fraud Detection Model

This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The goal is to proactively identify potential frauds and provide insights that can guide actionable strategies for fraud prevention.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of an internship task with the International School of AI & Data Science (INSAID). The data consists of over 6 million transactions, each described by 10 features, and the objective is to build a model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and multi-collinearity to prepare the data for model training.
- **Feature Selection**: Identification of the most important features that contribute to fraudulent behavior.
- **Model Development**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms to create a robust fraud detection model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Detailed analysis of the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Insights & Actionable Plans**: Analysis of key factors that predict fraudulent behavior and recommendations for infrastructure improvements to prevent fraud.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code development and visualization.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and others for building and evaluating the model.

## Business Context

The financial company provided a dataset of transactions, with the challenge to develop a model capable of identifying fraud. The solution involved statistical analysis and the creative application of machine learning techniques to fine-tune the model and interpret its predictions.

## Project Goals
1. Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.
2. Develop a predictive model for identifying fraudulent transactions.
3. Analyze the key factors influencing fraud detection.
4. Provide actionable recommendations for the company to update its infrastructure.
5. Evaluate the effectiveness of the model and implemented strategies.

## Results

The project successfully developed a fraud detection model with promising predictive capabilities. Key findings from the analysis and recommendations for future fraud prevention strategies were provided to help improve the company's infrastructure.

## Files in the Repository
- **Fraud_detection.ipynb**: Contains the complete code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Future Enhancements
- Further model optimization with additional machine learning techniques.
- Integration with real-time data for live fraud detection.
- Exploration of advanced methods like neural networks for improving prediction accuracy.
